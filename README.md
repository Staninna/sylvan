# sylvan

syvan is a simple operating system written in Rust. It is based on the [Writing an OS in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com/) blog series by Philipp Oppermann.
Don't expect anything fancy, it's just a hobby/learning project.
The name is made up by [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) cuz I'm bad at naming things. sylvan is a synonym for forest.
It is also my second attempt at writing an OS in Rust.
